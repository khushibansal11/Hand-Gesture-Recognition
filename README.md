Hand Gesture Recognition
This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It can recognize various hand gestures such as peace, rock, stop, thumbs up, and thumbs down. The project includes training the CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras, as well as deploying the model for inference.
